# NYUAD Interactive Campus Map

## Project Description

The NYUAD Interactive Campus Map is a web-based application designed to provide users with an immersive audio experience of the New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) campus. The core concept behind this project is to offer a sneak peek into the vibrant and diverse environment of NYUAD, not just through visuals but by allowing users to explore and listen to the sounds and activities that take place in different campus buildings. We aimed to create a realistic and fun experience with a touch of humor to engage our audience.

To visually represent the project, we designed a logo that resembles a sound wave, symbolizing the audio experience offered by the application. The text "New York University" is incorporated into the logo, representing the university the website represents. We also added a personalized touch to the project by requiring users to enter their NYUAD Net ID for access, making the website customizable for our target audience, which is our class.

## Process

Implementing the NYUAD Interactive Campus Map was a collaborative effort that involved various tasks, including audio recording, web design, map design, logo design, and more. We followed a structured process to bring this project to life.

### 1) Task Distribution
- **Audio Recording**: We divided the task of recording audio into teams, with each team responsible for a set of buildings. This allowed us to capture a diverse range of sounds and activities happening across the campus. However, managing background noise and ensuring high-quality audio recordings posed challenges, which required careful planning and editing.

- **Web Design**: Creating the web interface involved designing a user-friendly and visually appealing layout. We integrated the interactive map and audio playback features into the design to create a seamless user experience.

- **Map Design**: We worked on designing an SVG-based map of the campus, with individual buildings as clickable elements. Animated SVG elements were used to make buildings change color and move when hovered or clicked, enhancing user engagement.

- **Logo Design**: The project's visual identity, including the logo design, was a crucial element in conveying the audio experience. The sound wave-inspired logo with the university's text was crafted to symbolize the core concept.

### 2) Collaboration and Deadlines
We set deadlines and milestones for each aspect of the project to ensure a smooth development process. Regular meetings and communication were done for coordinating efforts and tracking progress. 

### 3) Audio Editing
Editing over 20 audio files for each building on campus presented a substantial challenge. However, we successfully incorporated many of our recorded audio files, ensuring a rich and diverse audio experience for users.

## Reflection/Evaluation

In retrospect, our journey in developing the NYUAD Interactive Campus Map was marked by both challenges and achievements. The initial learning curve in mastering audio equipment and dealing with background noise proved to be a valuable experience, eventually leading to high-quality audio recordings. Editing and integrating numerous audio files for each building presented a time-consuming yet rewarding task, ensuring a diverse and immersive audio experience for users. Despite these hurdles, we successfully delivered on our objective to provide an insightful and engaging sonic tour of NYUAD. The personalized touch of requiring Net ID for access added a unique and customizable element to the project. In conclusion, the project has not only met our expectations but also exceeded them by offering an authentic and immersive glimpse into the vibrant NYUAD campus through the auditory lens.
